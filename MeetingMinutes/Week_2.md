#### Questions 
* General question about barebones fulfillment of requirements vs ensuring we have conventional website design and elements (without over doing it)
* Alerts for upcoming appointments - what should this look like? list upcoming appointments prominantly on the dashboard ok? Or a pop up alert? 
What does upcoming mean? A timeframe that we determine? Or is there a setting that the user selects?
* Searching/Booking Appointments by Service Provider - this is not mentioned anywhere in the project requirments, but seems like it would be pretty standard. Should we include this functionality or is it overkill since not explicitly required?
* Similarly, nothing mentioned about specific services offered by service provider, only the category. Again, seems weird to not include. Do we want to include? And if so, can a service provider offer more than one service? And if so, when they set their availability, do they set by which service?
* Requirement states that a user can make/search/modify their appointment. What should the functionality be for modify? Just cancel? 
* Forgot password on login page - is pretty standard. Do we want this, if so, how to implement?
* User Appointment view - ok as just a list? Or should there be a calendar view?

#### UI Design Drafts

##### Login Page and Registration Page for all user types
